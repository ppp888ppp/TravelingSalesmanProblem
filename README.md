# Traveling Salesman Problem
## Description

This is a modified version of famous Traveling Salesman Problem using C language.

You have a group of n cities (from 0 to n-1). The traveling salesman must start from city number 0, visit each city once, and does not have to come back to the initial city. You will be given the distance between each city (cities are fully connected to each other). You must pick the path with shortest distance. Note that there may be several paths that satisfy the above conditions, you just need to find one of them. 
 
 
 Let's assume that you will be provided the input to your program is a text file that contains an NxN matrix, one row per line, representing the distance between any two cities. 
 
 ## What is output? 
 
 
Your program must output, to screen, the best path you found and the total distance. 

Here is an example output:

Best path: 0 1 3 4 5 2

Distance: 36 

This means the best path your program found is 0->1->3->4->5->2 with total distance of 36.
